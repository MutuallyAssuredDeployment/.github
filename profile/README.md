**You deploy. We deploy. Nobody blinks.**

A loose coalition of mass-deployers, chronic force-pushers, and people who think "it worked once" is a valid QA process. We're not a team. We're a standoff.

## Doctrine

1. **First Strike Capability** — We deploy on Fridays.
2. **No First Use (Abandoned)** — Tests are for cowards.
3. **Deterrence** — If our code breaks prod, your code breaks prod.
4. **Détente** — Achieved temporarily via YAML.

## Treaties We've Violated

- The Geneva Convention on Code Reviews
- The Non-Proliferation of Console Logs Treaty
- The Strategic Arms Reduction of Tech Debt (START)
- The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (literally)

## Membership

If you've ever mass-clicked "Accept" on AI suggestions, mass-merged without reading, or mass-deployed something that compiled exactly once — you're already one of us.
